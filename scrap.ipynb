The turn of events is unwelcome for Ukraine, whose understrength army is having a hard time keep bigger Russian forces at bay.\\n    \\nThe Ukrainian leader was in London to attend U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer\\u2019s effort to rally his European counterparts around continuing \\u2014 and likely much increased \\u2014 support for Ukraine from the continent amid political uncertainty in the U.S., and Trump\\u2019s overtures toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\nAsked by a reporter to comment about the outlines of a new European initiative to end Russia\\u2019s war, Zelenskyy said: \\u201cWe are talking about the first steps today, and therefore, until they are on paper, I would not like to talk about them in great detail.\\u201d\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n\\u201cAn agreement to end the war is still very, very far away, and no one has started all these steps yet. The peace that we foresee in the future must be just, honest, and most importantly, sustainable,\\u201d he added.Trump slammed Zelenskyy later Monday for suggesting that the end of Russia\\u2019s war against Ukraine is still far off. \\n    \\n\\u201cThis is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.\\u201cIt is what I was saying, this guy doesn\\u2019t want there to be Peace as long as he has America\\u2019s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. \\u2014 Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia,\\u201d Trump added in his post. \\u201cWhat are they thinking?\\u201dThe White House wants Zelenskyy to show more openness to potential concessions in order to bring the fighting to an end, but Zelenskyy resisted that idea while pressing for security guarantees from Washington during last Friday\\u2019s meeting.

Trump has said the economic deal with the U.S. would serve as a security guarantee for Ukraine against a future Russian invasion like the one that started the war in February 2022. But the deal was never signed and remains in limbo.Trump\\u2019s aides asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House after an Oval Office meeting featuring nearly an hour of remarks and questions from reporters devolved into a spat, which left the president angry and publicly questioning whether the Ukrainian leader wants to negotiate an end to the war.Zelenskyy\\u2019s public statements since he left the White House on Friday, including a social media post thanking Trump for hosting him and Americans for supporting Ukraine, have done little to move the president since then, and top administration officials believe that that peace talks with Ukraine are on hold, according to multiple administration officials.One of the administration officials said, \\u201cThe ball is in President Zelenskyy\\u2019s court.\\u201d\\u201cThe president believes Zelenskyy has to come back to the table and he has to be the one to come and make it right,\\u201d the official said.Another administration official said Zelenskyy so far has not publicly shown any regret for what the White House views as a disrespectful approach to a meeting in the Oval Office, adding that the official is \\u201cnot sure\\u201d where a peace process goes from here.Multiple administration officials pushed back on critics of how Trump handled the moment, some of whom have suggested that the tense exchange in the Oval Office between Trump and Zelenskyy was planned.\\u00a0Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the scene \\u201ca political ambush\\u201d in a statement on Friday.\\u201cIt was not planned at all. It was the exact opposite of how most people expected the exchange to go,\\u201d said a source familiar with the meeting.\\u00a0An administration official added, \\u201cThere was no setup.\\u201dEnding the war in Ukraine was one of Trump\\u2019s signature campaign promises, and he said during the 2024 race that he would do it within 24 hours of taking office. Friday\\u2019s developments left the president further away from achieving that goal, a little over two weeks after Trump said he\\u2019d spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and negotiations to end the war in Ukraine would begin \\u201cimmediately.\\u201d Trump then called Zelenskyy to inform him of his conversation with Putin.What followed was two weeks of public and private back-and-forth between U.S. and Ukrainian officials that, from the Trump administration\\u2019s view, was painstaking, according to two administration officials.\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a challenging couple of weeks,\\u201d one of the officials said.As three Trump administration officials put it, Zelenskyy approached meetings with top Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, from a standpoint of wanting more from the U.S., and they said he came off as ungrateful and unaware of the political shift in the U.S.\\u00a0After Zelenskyy declined to sign an early version of a minerals deal that the U.S. put before him, Trump became frustrated and publicly referred to the elected Ukrainian leader as a dictator.But negotiations on a minerals deal continued. In the days leading up to Zelenskyy\\u2019s meeting with Trump, Ukrainian officials pushed for language tweaks in the deal, two administration officials said.When Zelenskyy, during his remarks in the Oval Office, raised the idea of \\u201creal\\u201d security guarantees from the U.S. beyond the economic deal on Ukrainian minerals \\u2014 reiterating his longtime public posture \\u2014 his comments grated on some administration officials.\\u201cIt\\u2019s been abundantly clear to Zelenskyy that there would be no security guarantees in this deal,\\u201d one of the officials said.Administration officials said they are unsure precisely what Zelenskyy could do to convince Trump to re-engage on negotiations with him \\u2014 other than to have, from their perspective, a complete attitude change toward the president. They said Trump remains unconvinced that Zelenskyy wants to negotiate an end to the war at this time.\\u201cIt has not dawned on him the reality that there was a paradigm shift with the election on Nov. 6,\\u201d an administration official said of Zelenskyy.Asked if it\\u2019s still possible for the U.S. to work with Zelenskyy to reach a peace deal, another administration official said, \\u201cI still think so, yes.\\u201dZelenskyy has been in the U.K. this weekend for meetings with top European leaders trying to determine a way forward. He is set to attend a summit in London Sunday to discuss the war with more than 15 other European leaders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
